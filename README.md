This repository holds the Eclipse project named 'NeckVeins 1.0' with the source code to my application Neck Veins.
I developed it as a part of my bachelor's thesis "Visualisation of neck veins with OpenGL" at the University of Ljubljana.

It is meant for inspecting .obj files that I was given to work with during developement (as opposed to general .obj files).

DISCLAMER: I tried my best to respect the licenses of the libraries I used.
The compiled program may freeze if you use it to load an .obj file that is too big and use subdivision surface.
